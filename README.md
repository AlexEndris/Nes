# Nes
Some dabbling with C# and an NES Emulator

The solution is set up with two projects. One for the main emulation code, the other mainly for displaying something on the screen using MonoGame

## Next Steps
Get The APU running so I can hear sound and music.

## Known Bugs
(At least) In SMB there are some graphical bugs just after the header area of the screen sometimes, and (I think) some issues with sprite overflow. I haven't debugged any of that yet
